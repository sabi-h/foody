# Foody Project

This project is a simple Flask application named 'Foody'. It serves up a "Hello, World!" message.

## Getting Started

Below are the instructions to get the Foody Flask application up and running on your local machine using Docker.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)

### Installation

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/foody.git
cd foody

Running the Application
You can run the application using Docker Compose. This will build the image if it's not already present and start the container.

sh
Copy code
docker-compose up
After running the command, you should see output indicating that the Flask server is running on http://0.0.0.0:7007/. However, because of the port mapping specified in docker-compose.yml, you can access the application at http://localhost:8000.

Using the Application
To confirm that the application is running properly, open your web browser and navigate to:

arduino
Copy code
http://localhost:8000
You should see a "Hello, World!" message displayed.

Stopping the Application
To stop the application, run the following command:

sh
Copy code
docker-compose down
Development
If you want to develop the application further, you can make use of the bind mount specified in docker-compose.yml to reflect your changes in real-time. The FLASK_ENV=development environment variable will enable debug mode.

Running Tests
Describe how to run the automated tests for this system (if any). For example:

sh
Copy code
docker exec -it <container_id> pytest
Replace <container_id> with the actual container ID of your Flask application.

Deployment
These instructions are for development use and deployment only. For a production environment, additional configuration would be necessary.
